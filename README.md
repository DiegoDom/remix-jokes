# Remix JðŸ˜œkes App!
This is the result from follow the [Remix Jokes App Tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes#jokes-app-tutorial). As good as I expected.

## Database

From your terminal:

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

```sh
npx prisma db seed
```

## Development

From your terminal:


```sh
yarn install
```

```sh
yarn run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.



## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```
